        <h3>Chunchanakatte Falls (Kannada: ಚುಂಚನಕಟ್ಟೆ ಜಲಪಾತ ಅಥವಾ ಚುಂಚನಕಟ್ಟೆ ಫಾಲ್ಸ್) is a waterfall on the Kaveri River, near the village of Chunchanakatte in krishnarajanagar taluk of Mysore district, Karnataka, India. Water cascades from a height of about 20 meters. It is in the Western Ghats. Here the river falls in two small cascades before joining again to flow as one. The waterfall can be reached by taking a diversion at Krishnarajanagar on the Mysore-Hassan highway. Chunchanakatte is the holy place where Lord Sri Rama during his vanvas stopped by and availed the hospitality of a tribal couple called Chuncha and Chunchi. The significance of this place is that the sound of the powerful falls can be heard all over except inside the sanctum sanctorum of the centuries-old temple, the story goes that Lord Rama was tired of the constant complaining of Sita Mata and gave a curse saying that the tongue of a woman should not be sharp and since Cauvery (river) is considered to be female the noise that the river generated would not be heard in the sanctum sanctorum of the lord. It is also said that when Sita Mata was tired and weary and wanted to have a bath, Lord Ram directed Lakshman to fire an arrow at a rock, once Lakshmana fired the arrow, water in 3 different shades started pouring out, one with turmeric, one with oil and one with shikakai (fruit for hair - natural shampoo). These shades are visible even today when there is considerable amount of water flowing in the falls. </h3>

        <img src="../image/bala.jpg">
        <h3>Balmuri falls is a small water cascade located at Srirangapatna in Karnataka. Though known as a waterfall, it is a human-made check dam over the Cauvery river, which allows the water to flow in a 6-foot cascade over the Cauvery. Green coconut palms and trees adorn the shores and the gushing cascade of water sparkle in the sun, which is why the spot is quite scenic where many song sequences in Kannada and a few Hindi films have been shot! Now, isn’t that inviting enough for all you photographers out there to spend a day out wading over the waters and capturing beautiful pictures!</h3>
